This directory contains little wrappers to help make your life
running a full Internet-facing web server (such as woozle.org)
a little easier.

Quite a lot of web software these days is written to work with
Apache and nothing else.  PHP is a notable example: even PHP-CGI,
as shipped on Debian, requires special environment variables that
only Apache sets, and doesn't work with, e.g. mathopd, boa, busybox
httpd, or eris.
