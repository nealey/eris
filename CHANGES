	Changed formatting of directory indexing
	Handle read timeout
	Fix if-modified-since bug with keepalive connections

3.0:
	More or less a ground-up rewrite.	A few fnord parts remain
		here and there.

2.0:
	Replace poll with select, which is more portable and may be
		slightly faster; however, it's only called for CGI and by
		that point you've lost quite a bit in terms of speed
	Remove Accept header parsing: it was broken and the result was
		that the Accept header had no effect
	Remove the .gz trick: I never used it, but I would not be averse
		to adding it back if people liked it

1.10:
	have fallback in case sendfile fails

1.9:
	chdir to cgi's base dir (Kuba Winnicki)
	set HTTP_ACCEPT_ENCODING environment variable (Kuba Winnicki)
		We actually should export all HTTP headers as HTTP_[header]
		Any takers?
	Try not to send error message HTTP headers if we already sent the
		headers from the CGI (Kuba Winnicki)
	<ims -> <=ims (Gerrit Pape)
	64-bit file I/O cleanliness
	fix HTTP ranges (Joachim Berdal Haga via Gerrit Pape)

1.8:
	keep current environment in CGI (Laurent Bercot)
	make fnord-conf use the UID and not the user name (Fridtjof Busse)
	fix typo in buffer_putulonglong (Gerrit Pape)
	fix CGI POST off-by-two typo (Mark Hopf)
	fix gif->png conversion (Thomas Seck)
	remove == bashism from fnord-conf (Thomas Seck)

	make authorization data available to CGIs for GET, too (Paul Jarc)
	fix conversion of host name to lower case (Gerrit Pape)
	add small test cgi: cgi-post.c
	fix CGI POST bug (Moe Wibble)
	fix CGI PATH_TRANSLATED bug (Nicolas George)
	add optional authentication support (Nicolas George, see README.auth)
	make sure error messages are text/html
	move /. -> /: conversion before demangling so it can actually be
		used as security measure for installations that don't use chroot

1.7:
	add .mov and .qt for quicktime, .mpg for video/mpeg and .wav for audio/x-wav
	add mmap based file serving (should do zero-copy tcp just like sendfile)
	add Pragma: no-cache to CGI responses
	fix (apparently not exploitable) buffer overrun in do_cgi
		This bug was found by Ralf Wildenhues.	To my knowledge it is
		impossible to exploit this bug on any platform known to me.
	fix (harmless) access to uninitialized data

1.6:
	add support for $PATH_INFO in CGI environment.
	add .pac for netscape proxy autoconfig
	add .sig for application/pgp-signature

1.5:
	fix write timeout handling (found by Lukas Beeler)
	fix fnord-conf to use the symbolic account name in run script
		(Sebastian D.B. Krause)

1.4:
	add dangling symlink based whole-host redirection (see README).	This
		has the advantage that it can serve normal sites and redirect sites
		on the same IP.
	add support for non-TCP UCSPI environments (like ucspi-ssl).	Please
		get the latest version of my ucspi-tcp IPv6 patch as I violated the
		UCSPI spec with all versions before 0.88-diff11.
	change logging from "127.0.0.1 200 23 Links_(0.96;_Unix) none /index.html"
		to "127.0.0.1 200 23 localhost Links_(0.96;_Unix) none /index.html"
		(i.e. include the Host: header).	Suggested by Thomas Bader.
	add "immediate mode".	If you give fnord a command line argument, it
		will change to that directory and if no "default" directory is
		given, it will assume there are no virtual hosts and serve from the
		current directory.	I have a shell script called "http" that does
			tcpserver -RHl localhost 0 8000 /home/leitner/bin/fnord-idx .
		to share some directory on my hard drive with some poor Windows
		users without npoll (http://www.fefe.de/ncp/).	fnord-idx is a new
		target (a fnord with DIR_LIST) that is auto-built by make.

1.3:
	make directory listings use non-proportional fonts (thanks, Antonio Dias)
	fnord will now optionally (default: enabled) normalize the incoming
		host name, i.e. "www.domain.com" -> "www.domain.com:80".	That
		should cut down on the number of symbolic links. ;)
	remove timeout error message.	fnord will not drop the connection
		without error message.	Mozilla used to display the error message
		when the user caused another request on the connection with the
		timeout.
	Uwe Ohse found two more compilation problems.

1.2:
	Olaf: I changed my initial CGI-interface to NOT use the filesystem but
		two pipes.
	Add whole-host redirect (see README)
	Olaf: added directory-lists and "index.cgi" support (normal CGI only !
		"nph-index.cgi" is not supported). Fixed some problematic parts in the
		CGI-interface (\n -> \r\n converter for http-header and CGI crash
		handling)
	Fix gzip encoding bug that only happened with keep-alive

1.1:
	ship with the parts from libowfat that we actually use
	minor speed-up.	sendfile is a drag for very small files, so those are
		now sent through the same buffer the header is sent through.	That
		sends the whole answer in one TCP packet if you are lucky, even
		without the TCP_CORK magic from Linux.	Major speed-up for
		benchmarks ;)

1.0:
	initial release
